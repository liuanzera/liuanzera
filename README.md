## 🚀 What I'm Building (and Optimizing)

* **Robust Design Systems:** I'm always organizing and standardizing components (over 50 in my last project) in Figma using Auto-Layout and Variants, which has helped reduce handoff time by up to 25% for remote teams.
* **CRO Strategies:** I've executed more than 30 A/B tests to enhance lead conversion, resulting in a fantastic 50% increase in both conversion rates and lead volume!
* **User Flows:** I focus on redesigning key friction points to boost product adoption and retention, achieving a 12% drop in initial user drop-off.
* **Accessibility (WCAG):** I prioritize creating accessible products that tackle real-world problems, with a keen eye on global and cross-cultural user experiences.

## 🛠️ My Favorite Tools (Tech Stack)

* **Design:** Figma (I’m a pro, especially with Design Systems), Adobe Creative Suite.
* **Optimization:** Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), A/B Testing, UX Research & Usability Testing.
